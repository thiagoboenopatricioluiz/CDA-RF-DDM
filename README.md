A Data-Driven Model for Groundwater Level Prediction in an outcrop zone of the Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) in southern Brazil. This repository include the data set used to training the models and the Climate Driver Approach (CDA) code to analyze the data and improve the fittings, which induces the choice of a more correlated set of climate predictors for the models.
