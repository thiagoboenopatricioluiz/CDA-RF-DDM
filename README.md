# CDA-RF-DDM
A Data-Driven Model for Groundwater Level Prediction in an outcrop zone of the Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) in southern Brazil. This repository include the data set used to training the models with the Climate Driver Approach (CDA), which induces the choice of a more correlated set of climate predictors for the models to improve the fittings.
